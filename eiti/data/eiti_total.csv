Total Received by Govt includes unilateral receipts from small traders (comptoirs) and quarries (le secteur d’exploitation des carrières), and ""other"" unilaterally reported revenues. The government unilaterally reported transfers it made to local governments of 3,844,321,277 GNF and transfers it made to the Fonds d'Investissement Minier totalling 24,645,489,166 GNF (see p.46-49); these transfers are not included in revenue/payment totals. Subtotals by commodity cannot be calculated based on company-by-company data in Annex 6 because some companies produce more than one commodity, or did not report which commodity they produce. State revenues by commodity presented on p.45 cannot be used here because they include payments reported unilaterally by companies as well as those reported unilaterally by govt."
