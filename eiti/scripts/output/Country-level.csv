The report notes that 67 companies were asked to report, but only 58 are named. The report doesn't distinguish between oil and gas companies, or between mining companies producing different commodities. Unilateral declarations are included in the figures. Oil and gas revenues reported account for 100% of the cashflows contributed by the sector for the selcted revenue streams. Mining revenues reported account for 50% of the cashflows contributed by the sector for the selected revenue streams, but the mining companies covered account for 71.4% of the production value of the sector in 2011, which is given in the report as US$217,469,880. Given the production value of the mining sector is given in the report, production information for individual mining commodities has not been collected.

The actual volumes allocated to NHC Functioning, a SOC, as payment in-kind are not provided by the report, but it notes that NHC Functioning received around 66.4% of production. The value of this payment in kind is not given in the report, but has been calculated using the relevant commodity prices from the BPSR 2014 (detailed below). The revenue stream 'proportional mining royalty' is the amount that permits every partner in the process of oil production to benefit from a guaranteed percentage on the annual rent according to the terms of the contract, and can be a positive or negative payment to Government. When it is negative, it represents the amount due by the Government to the oil companies.

The actual volumes allocated to NHC Functioning, a SOC, as payment in-kind are not provided by the report, but it notes that NHC Functioning received around 66.8% of production. The value of this payment in kind is not given in the report, but has been calculated using the relevant commodity prices from the BPSR 2014 (detailed below). The revenue stream 'proportional mining royalty' is the amount that permits every partner in the process of oil production to benefit from a guaranteed percentage on the annual rent according to the terms of the contract, and can be a positive or negative payment to Government. When it is negative, it represents the amount due by the Government to the oil companies.

This means all oil & gas producers are reconciled. Disaggregation by commodity is only indirect through disaggregation by company, and therefore limited. Unilateral declarations are included in the figures: US$497,487 of payments outside the reconciliation scope and US$118,687 of social contributions reported by companies, and US$894,430 of payments from companies below the materiality threshold reported by government. The value of the payments made in-kind included in the figures for 2011 is not consistent with the volume of payments made-in kind in 2011 given the time lapse between the oil being transferred and commercialised. The value of the latter is not clear, but the volume has been indicated in the appropriate column. Total payments given on pg.8 do not appear to be consistent with the reconciliation results on pg 32-33 and unilateral declarations on pg 39-45. NHC has two functions. NHC-Operation operates as a company, involved in a number of oil concessions both directly and indirectly as a shareholder of other companies. NHC-Mandate is a state agency, managing the commercialisation of Government's share in the oil extracted. COTCO is a oil transport company, which the Government has a shareholding, indirectly through NHC, of 5.17%. The revenue stream 'proportional mining royalty' is the amount that permits every partner in the process of oil production to benefit from a guaranteed percentage on the annual rent according to the terms of the contract, and can be a positive or negative payment to Government. When it is negative, it represents the amount due by the Government to the oil companies. In 2011 it was negative and has therefore been classified as a subsidy.

Materiality threshold: All oil & gas comapnies operating in the Jubilee and Saltpond field should be reconciled; the largest mining companies which paid 99% of mineral royalties in 2011 should be reconciled. The report doesn't distinguish between oil and gas producers. Oil and gas payments are only comprehensively disaggregated by revenue stream. Resolved discrepancies are not included in the final figures for mining payments, but there is insufficent information to add these retrospectively. Unilateral declarations do not appear to be included in the figures. Almost 100% of oil payments were made in kind, with the average barrel of oil being valued at $113.

These mining companies accounted for 81% of royalty payments in 2009. Unilateral declarations are included. The report doesn't indicate how the value of payments in-kind are calculated. Under Indonesian tax law, disclosure of amounts of taxes paid by taxpayers is prohibited, unless taxpayers provide consent. A number of companies did not provide this consent for some or all of their tax payments and therefore these have not been reported on by Government, even though the company has reported on them. Domestic Market Obligation fees, classified here as subsidies, are paid by Government to oil & gas PSC Contractors to supply a portion of their oil and gas liftings to the domestic market. The report doesn't distinguish between oil and gas producers. Disaggregation by commodity is only indirect through disaggregation by company, and therefore limited.

Materiality threshold: All oil and gas operators and non-operators of Production Sharing Contract (PSC) areas in 2010 from which the Government of Indonesia obtained a share of production in one form or another should be reconciled; mining companies that made royalty payments of at least IDR25bn should be reconciled. These mining companies accounted for 83% of royalty payments in 2010. The report doesn't indicate how the government liftings of oil and gas are calculated, but notes that the price for DMO crude for up to 60 months of production is 10-25%  of the Indonesia Crude Price. Unilateral declarations are included. Under Indonesian tax law, disclosure of amounts of taxes paid by taxpayers is prohibited, unless taxpayers provide consent. A number of companies did not provide this consent for some or all of their tax payments and therefore these have not been reported on by Government, even though the company has reported on them. Domestic Market Obligation fees, classified here as subsidies, are paid by Government to oil & gas PSC Contractors to supply a portion of their oil and gas liftings to the domestic market. The report doesn't distinguish between oil and gas producers. Disaggregation by commodity is only indirect through disaggregation by company, and therefore limited. PT Pertamina (Persero) is a SOC involved in upstream oil and gas activities, as well as midstream and downstream activities. PT Pertamina EP is a subsidiary which manages the upstream activities of previous (onshore) working areas throughout Indonesia, while PT Pertamina Hulu Energi (PHE) is involved in new working areas. PT Aneka Tambang (Persero) Tbk, PT Timah (Persero) Tbk, and PT Bukit Asam (Persero) Tbk are SOCs involved in mining activities.

Materiality threshold: All oil and gas operators and non-operators of Production Sharing Contract (PSC) areas in 2011 from which the Government of Indonesia obtained a share of production in one form or another should be reconciled; mining companies that made royalty payments of at least IDR25bn should be reconciled. These mining companies accounted for 81% of royalty payments in 2011. The report doesn't indicate how the government liftings of oil and gas are calculated, but notes that the price for DMO crude for up to 60 months of production is 10-25%  of the Indonesia Crude Price. Unilateral declarations are included. Under Indonesian tax law, disclosure of amounts of taxes paid by taxpayers is prohibited, unless taxpayers provide consent. A number of companies did not provide this consent for some or all of their tax payments and therefore these have not been reported on by Government, even though the company has reported on them. Domestic Market Obligation fees, classified here as subsidies, are paid by Government to oil & gas PSC Contractors to supply a portion of their oil and gas liftings to the domestic market. The report doesn't distinguish between oil and gas producers. Disaggregation by commodity is only indirect through disaggregation by company, and therefore limited. PT Pertamina (Persero) is a SOC involved in upstream oil and gas activities, as well as midstream and downstream activities. PT Pertamina EP is a subsidiary which manages the upstream activities of previous (onshore) working areas throughout Indonesia, while PT Pertamina Hulu Energi (PHE) is involved in new working areas. PT Aneka Tambang (Persero) Tbk, PT Timah (Persero) Tbk, and PT Bukit Asam (Persero) Tbk are SOCs involved in mining activities.

The report doesn't distinguish between oil and gas producers. The report gives the volumes but not values for the payments in kind. The values are calculated using the relevant commodity price from the BPSR 2014 (detailed below). Unilateral declarations are included in the figures. Disaggregation by commodity is only indirect through disaggregation by company, and therefore limited. Sasol Petroleum Temane Ltd, a South African Energy Company, currently operates the Pande and Temane Natural Gas Fields with Companhia Moçambicana de Hidrocarbonetos SARL (CMH) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Sasol Petroleum Temane Ltd is the operator and majority shareholder with 70% shares, with CMH having 25% and IFC with 5% share interest. CMH's shareholding structure comprises of 70% to Empresa Nactional de Hidrocarbonetos Company (ENH), 20% to the Government of Mozambique and 10% owned by corporate bodies and individuals. ENH is the National Oil Company of Mozambique and is 100% owned by the State. The Pande-Temane gas project includes a gas pipeline between Temane and a Sasol gas processing petrochemical complex in Secunda, South Africa. This is operated by Republic of Mozambique Pipeline Company (Rompco), which is owned by SASOL (50%), CMH (25%) and iGas, a subsidiary of the South Africa Energy Fund (25%). Sasol Petroleum Mocambique Ltd is also involved in this project. The payment in kind of natural gas is for part of Sasol Petroleum Temane Ltd's royalty obligations. Its value is calculated with a 'weight factor' in use by the National Oil Institute. The report provides production volumes for some companies, but this is not comprehensive.
